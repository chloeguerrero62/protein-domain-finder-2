# Protein Domain Finder 2

## Overview

This repository provides a **fully reproducible pipeline** for large-scale and per-protein domain boundary discovery using 3D protein structure data.  
All main analyses, tables, and figures can be generated by running the `protein_domain_workflow.ipynb` [Jupyter Notebook](./protein_domain_workflow.ipynb) with the provided scripts and dependencies.

## Quick Start

1. **Clone and Install Requirements**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/chloeguerrero62/protein-domain-finder-2.git
    cd protein-domain-finder-2
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    # or:
    # conda env create -f environment.yml
    # conda activate protein-domain-finder
    ```

2. **Run the Notebook**
    ```
    jupyter notebook protein_domain_workflow.ipynb
    ```
    or
    ```
    jupyter lab protein_domain_workflow.ipynb
    ```
    - Run all cells from top to bottom.
    - This will execute all steps, analyses, and display figures and results.

## Notes

- All analyses and figures from the presentation are reproduced by the notebook.
- Most additional Python scripts are called automatically as part of the workflow.
- Results and figures are saved in the `data/results/` directory.
